## Purpose

This tool serves as a dedicated pixel editor for generating sprites used in embedded systems and microcontroller projects. Its primary function is to provide a clean drawing canvas and then output the corresponding memory representation required by hardware displays.

It allows developers and hobbyists to:

* Visually design custom pixel sprites.
* Generate raw bitmap arrays (pixel data) that directly represent the drawn image.
* Easily copy the output data for seamless integration into your project code.

## Compatibility & Integration

The bitmap array format generated by this editor is optimized for use with common monochrome display controllers and graphics libraries.
U8g2 Library Support

* The generated bitmap array is directly compatible with the U8g2 (Universal Graphics Library), a widely used library for Arduino and other microcontrollers.

* Data Format: The output adheres to the library's required column-major, page-based format (8 vertical pixels packed into one byte).

## Usage:
You can paste the generated data directly into your C/C++ code as a const uint8_t array and draw it onto your display using the u8g2.drawXBM() function (XBM stands for X-Bitmap).
